    <h1>WAKE UP MR.WEST</h1>

    <p>
      Listen. They don't get it. I'm not just making music. I'm crafting
      dimensions. Time, sound, space, it's all connected. Why settle for a beat
      when I can drop a universe? Y'all still thinking in 4/4 time; I'm over
      here reinventing silence. Picasso didn't ask for permission; neither do I.
      They say, 'Ye, chill, you can't call yourself a god.' But why not? God
      made the sun, and I made Graduation. Same energy. When Beethoven dropped
      his symphonies, you think he worried about haters? Nah, he just let that
      bassline breathe. My ideas are too big for this Earth. That's why I'm
      already designing clothes for Martians. Gap? Nike? Adidas? That was
      practice. When I'm done, every human being will be wearing their soul on
      their sleeve. Watch me. I'm not crazy; I'm just ahead of my time. They
      called Tesla crazy, too, but now look. You're scrolling this on his vibes.
      Remember that when you doubt me.
